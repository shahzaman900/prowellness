<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Link to Hypertension</h3>
<p>Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a significant risk factor for stroke. It can cause damage to the arteries, making them more susceptible to blockages or bursts, leading to ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes. Managing blood pressure is crucial in reducing the risk of stroke.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Prevention and Management</h3>
<p>Preventing stroke involves managing risk factors like hypertension. This includes:</p>
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>maintaining a healthy diet</li>
<li>regular exercise</li>
<li>quitting smoking, </li>
<li>regular health check-ups to monitor blood pressure levels. </li>
