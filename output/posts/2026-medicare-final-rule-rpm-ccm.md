The landscape of healthcare is continually evolving, and the latest changes from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) are creating

unprecedented opportunities

for providers focused on remote patient monitoring (RPM) and chronic care management (CCM). ProactiveWellness Care, recently hosted a pivotal webinar with expert Rob Sanchez to break down the

2026 Medicare Final Rule

and what it means for your practice.

Why RPM and CCM Are Essential for the Future of Care

The shift toward remote care isn’t a trend; it’s a foundation. Since 2018, CMS has been progressively expanding coverage for connected care services, with a core focus on

improving patient outcomes

and reducing costly hospitalizations. The 2026 Final Rule is the next major step, transforming these services into a core component of chronic care.

💡 Key Updates from the 2026 Medicare Final Rule

The new rule introduces significant changes that enhance flexibility and financial sustainability for providers.

1. New CPT Codes and Reimbursement Parity

CMS has added two new CPT codes for RPM, expanding the billing options:

CPT 99445:

Covers 2–15 days of data monitoring.

CPT 99470:

Covers 10–19 minutes of monitoring time.

Crucially, these new codes for shorter monitoring periods will be

reimbursed at the same rate

as the existing codes for longer periods. This “reimbursement parity” encourages “right-sized” care plans tailored to patient needs, rather than rigid billing rules.

2. Concurrent Billing and Code Stacking

Providers can now bill for

CCM and RPM concurrently in the same month

, which was previously restricted. This shift strongly encourages integrated care models, where CMS rewards providers who combine remote monitoring, medication management, and care coordination.

3. Expanded Services and Supervision

RTM Expansion:

Remote Therapeutic Monitoring (RTM) is expanded to include services for medication adherence and behavioral health.

Virtual Supervision:

The rule makes virtual supervision

permanent

. For “incident-to” billing, the physician now only needs to provide

general supervision

and does not need to be physically in the office

💰 Maximizing Revenue with Integrated Care Models

The 2026 Final Rule creates new reimbursement opportunities, especially through

code stacking

.

Service Layer

CPT Code Example

Monthly Revenue Potential (Per Patient)

RPM (Remote Patient Monitoring)

99453, 99454, 99457/99458

$55–$60

CCM (Chronic Care Management)

99490/99439

$62–$75

Total Potential

Stacked

$120–$135 per patient per month

By layering these programs, practices can capture revenue for shorter monitoring periods and brief check-ins that were previously uncompensated. This increases

recurring revenue per patient

and provides a clearer path to financial sustainability for remote care program.

Example Workflow:

A 72-year-old patient with hypertension and diabetes is enrolled in both RPM and CCM. The practice can bill for device setup (

99453

) and daily data transmission (

99454

), plus monthly staff time for monitoring (

99457/99458

) and non-face-to-face care coordination (

99490/99439

).

✅ Staying Compliant and Acting Now

To capitalize on these opportunities,

compliance

is paramount. Ensure your practice follows these guidelines:

Documentation:

Required documentation includes time spent, device data, and proof of patient engagement.

Patient Consent:

Patient consent must be obtained and properly recorded before initiating services.

Workflows:

Clear workflows are essential to delegate monitoring and engagement to trained staff, use technology for automated tracking, and avoid duplication or audit risk.

CMS continues to emphasize care coordination in payment models. Early implementation of these updated rules not only builds recurring revenue but also fosters stronger patient relationships, leading to higher retention.

If you’re ready to align with MIPS, ACO, and quality incentive goals, Proactive Wellness offers options from

Turnkey Enrollment Campaigns

to a
