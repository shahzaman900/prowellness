<li><strong>Easier access to care</strong>: RPM can reduce the need for frequent visits to the clinic or hospital, which can be difficult or costly for elderly patients who have mobility issues or live in remote areas. RPM can also enable timely interventions and prevent complications by alerting the care team of any changes in the patient’s condition<a href="https://coordinationcentric.com/benefits-of-remote-patient-monitoring/"><sub>2</sub></a>.<br/></li>
<li><strong>Improved feedback and support</strong>: RPM can enhance the communication and relationship between patients and their care providers, as they can receive more personalized and continuous feedback and guidance on their health status and treatment plan. RPM can also help patients feel more confident and empowered in managing their own health<a href="https://caresimple.com/benefits-of-remote-patient-monitoring-for-patients/"><sub>3</sub></a>.<br/></li>
<li><strong>Reduced healthcare costs</strong>: RPM can lower the healthcare expenses for elderly patients by avoiding unnecessary hospitalizations, emergency department visits, or readmissions.
