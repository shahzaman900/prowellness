<p>Studies published in reputable American medical journals like the <strong>Journal of the American Heart Association (</strong><a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/journal/jaha" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><strong>https://www.ahajournals.org/journal/jaha</strong></a><strong>)</strong> have shown a significant correlation between PTSD and hypertension. Here’s why: </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Chronic Stress:</strong> PTSD can trigger the body’s “fight-or-flight” response, leading to the release of stress hormones like cortisol. Chronically elevated cortisol levels can put a strain on the cardiovascular system, increasing blood pressure. <br/> </li>
<li><strong>Unhealthy Habits:</strong> People with PTSD may be more likely to engage in unhealthy coping mechanisms like smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, or poor diet, all of which contribute to hypertension. <br/> </li>
<li><strong>Sleep Disturbances:</strong> PTSD can disrupt sleep patterns, and sleep deprivation has been linked to an increased risk of hypertension. </li>
</ul>
