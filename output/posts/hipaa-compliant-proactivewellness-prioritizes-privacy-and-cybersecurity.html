<p>Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) platforms collect and transmit sensitive patient data, including vital signs, medical history, and treatment information.  A data breach in this system could have devastating consequences, exposing patients to identity theft, fraudulent medical claims, and even emotional distress. </p>
<p>At ProactiveWellness, we understand the importance of continuous health monitoring while safeguarding your patients’ privacy. That’s why we prioritize robust cybersecurity measures in our <strong>HIPAA-Compliant </strong>RPM platform </p>
