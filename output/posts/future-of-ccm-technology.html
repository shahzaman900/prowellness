<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Key Technologies Shaping Chronic Care Management</strong> </h2>
<p><strong><em>1. Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM)</em></strong> </p>
<p>RPM enables healthcare providers to track patients’ vital signs and health data in real-time. Devices like <strong>blood pressure monitors, glucometers, and pulse oximeters</strong> provide continuous data, allowing doctors to intervene before complications arise. This reduces hospital visits and improves patient compliance with treatment plans. </p>
<p><strong><em>2. Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare</em></strong> </p>
<p>AI-driven analytics can predict health risks, recommend personalized treatment plans, and assist clinicians in decision-making. Machine learning algorithms analyze large datasets to detect patterns, ensuring early intervention for chronic conditions. </p>

<p><strong><em>3. Telehealth and Virtual Care</em></strong> </p>
<p>Virtual consultations are making healthcare more accessible. Patients can consult specialists without the need for travel, ensuring timely interventions and reducing healthcare costs. </p>
<p><strong><em>4. Wearable and IoT Devices</em></strong> </p>
<p>Wearables like <strong>smartwatches, ECG monitors, and fitness trackers</strong> are empowering individuals to take charge of their health. These devices provide real-time data, allowing users to monitor their conditions and make informed lifestyle choices. </p>
<p><strong><em>5. Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and Data Integration</em></strong> </p>
<p>Seamless integration of patient data across healthcare systems ensures better coordination among providers. AI-powered EHRs can flag potential health issues and provide insights for proactive care management. </p>
