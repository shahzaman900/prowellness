Remote patient monitoring (RPM) is a healthcare technology that allows healthcare providers to monitor patients remotely. This can be done through a variety of methods, such as wearable devices, sensors, and telehealth. RPM devices are becoming increasingly popular for people with diabetes. These devices allow patients to track their blood sugar levels, insulin intake, and other important health data from home. This information can then be shared with healthcare providers, who can use it to make adjustments to treatment plans and prevent complications.

Benefits

There are many benefits to using RPM for diabetes management. RPM can help patients:

Track their blood sugar levels more frequently. This can help patients identify trends in their blood sugar levels and make adjustments to their treatment plan as needed.

Receive real-time feedback from their healthcare provider. This can help patients stay on track with their treatment plan and make better decisions about their health.

Feel more connected to their healthcare provider. This can improve patient satisfaction and adherence to treatment.

Studies

A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that RPM can help improve blood sugar control in people with type 2 diabetes. The study found that patients who used RPM had lower HbA1c levels (a measure of blood sugar control) than patients who did not use RPM.

Another study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that RPM can help reduce the risk of hospitalization in people with type 1 diabetes. The study found that patients who used RPM had a

30%

lower risk of being hospitalized for diabetes-related complications than patients who did not use RPM.

Importance of Tracking Diabetes

For patients, it is important to keep a track of your blood sugar using RPM devices. Here are some of the reasons why monitoring your diabetes with RPM devices is necessary and should be a regular thing:

To help you manage your blood sugar levels. One of the most important things you can do to manage diabetes is to keep your blood sugar levels in a healthy range. RPM devices can help you do this by providing you with real-time data about your blood sugar levels. This data can help you identify patterns in your blood sugar levels and make adjustments to your diet, exercise, and medication as needed.

To prevent complications. Diabetes can lead to a number of serious complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, blindness, and amputation. RPM devices can help you prevent these complications by helping you manage your blood sugar levels and identify any potential problems early on.

Continuous Monitoring

: ProactiveWellness allows physicians to remotely monitor important health parameters of their diabetic patients, such as blood glucose levels, blood pressure, heart rate, and weight. This continuous monitoring helps in gaining a more comprehensive understanding of patients’ health status and identifying any potential issues or trends.

Timely Interventions

: With ProactiveWellness’ real-time dashboard, physicians can check up on when patient’s health parameters deviate from the target range or when any critical issues arise.

Physicians can monitor patients’ adherence to the medication schedule and provide timely reminders or interventions when necessary. Better medication adherence leads to improved glycemic control and overall management of diabetes.

Diabetes can be a very challenging condition to manage. RPM is a valuable tool for diabetes management. It can help patients track their blood sugar levels more frequently, receive real-time feedback from their healthcare provider, and feel more connected to their healthcare provider. These benefits can help improve blood sugar control and reduce the risk of hospitalization.
