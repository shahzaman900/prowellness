Remote patient monitoring (RPM) is a technology that allows patients to measure and share their vital signs and other health data with their healthcare providers from a distance. RPM can be used for various purposes, such as managing chronic conditions, monitoring acute symptoms, or providing hospital-level care at home.

RPM has many benefits for patients, especially for the elderly population who may face challenges in accessing regular care or living independently. Here are some of the must-try benefits of RPM for elderly care:

Easier access to care

: RPM can reduce the need for frequent visits to the clinic or hospital, which can be difficult or costly for elderly patients who have mobility issues or live in remote areas. RPM can also enable timely interventions and prevent complications by alerting the care team of any changes in the patient’s condition

Improved feedback and support

RPM can also help patients feel more confident and empowered in managing their own health
