            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-4">
              <li>
                <strong>Contact Data:</strong> This is the data you provide us when you sign up for our services, such as your name, job title, company name, organization type, phone number, and email address. We use this data to communicate with you, offer you consultations or demos of our products, and send you relevant information about our services.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Support Data:</strong> This is the data we collect from you when you contact us for support or to report a problem, such as your IP address, log files, and other technical data. We use this data to help you resolve your issues, provide you with customer support, update our software, and improve our website in accordance with this privacy policy.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Technology Data:</strong> This is the data we automatically collect from your browser or device when you visit our website or interact with our emails or other communications, such as your device ID, location, browser type, internet service provider, mobile carrier, pages and files you viewed, searches you made, operating system, and date and time of your usage. We use this data to understand how you use our website, provide and enhance our website, and ensure the security and functionality of our website.

              At ProactiveWellness Care, we care about your privacy and want to be transparent about how we handle your personal data. This privacy policy explains what data we collect from you when you use our website, why we collect it, and how we use it.
            </p>
  
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-4">
              <li>
                <strong>Website Engagement:</strong> When you interact with our website, such as signing up for our newsletter, requesting information, or booking a consultation or demo, we collect some personal data from you, such as your name, email address, phone number, and location. We use this data to communicate with you, provide you with relevant information, and improve our services.
              </li>
              <li>

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Clear GIFs:</strong> We use a technology called clear GIFs (also known as web beacons, web bugs, or pixel tags) along with other technologies like e-tags and JavaScript to help us better manage the content on our website and measure its effectiveness. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics that are embedded invisibly on web pages and track the online movements of web users. Unlike cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are about the size of a dot and do not store any personal data. We do not link the data collected by clear GIFs, e-tags, or JavaScript to your personal data.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>SDKs and Mobile Advertising IDs:</strong> Our website may include third-party SDKs (software development kits) that allow us and our service providers to collect information about your activity on our website. Some mobile devices also have a resettable advertising ID (such as Apple’s IDFA or Google’s Advertising ID) that, like cookies and pixel tags, allow us and our service providers to identify your device over time and show you personalized ads. You can reset your advertising ID or opt out of interest-based advertising in your device settings.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Third-Party Plugins:</strong> Our website may include plugins from other companies, such as social media buttons or widgets. These plugins may collect information about the pages you visit on our website and share it with the company that created the plugin, even if you do not click on or interact with it. We have no control over and are not responsible for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. We strongly advise you to review the privacy policy of every site you visit.
              </li>
               <li>
                <strong>Third-Party Online Tracking:</strong> We may also partner with certain third parties to collect, analyze, and use some of the information described above. For example, we may allow third parties to set cookies or use web beacons on our website or in our email communications. This information may be used for various purposes, such as online website analytics and interest-based advertising.

            <h3>How We Use our Cookies on our Website</h3>
            <p>
              Cookies are small text files that our website places and stores on your computer or mobile device. These files help us remember information you enter, preferences you select, and how you move around our website. We use cookies and other technologies to provide you with more relevant and personalized information, and to make our website easier and safer to use.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our cookies do not store any personal data by themselves. We also do not combine the general information we collect through cookies with any other personal data to identify you. However, we may use cookies to recognize your web browser and link it to your user account (if you have one).
            </p>
            <p>
              We currently use cookies for Google Analytics. This helps us measure how users and email recipients interact with our website and email messages, and how we can improve our services.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can manage your cookie preferences at any time by changing your browser settings or using our cookie consent tool.
            </p>
  
            <h3>How to OPT out of Cookies</h3>
            <p>
              You can choose to disable or delete cookies from your browser settings at any time. However, if you do so, some parts of our website may not work properly or as intended. You may also miss out on some of the features and benefits we offer.
            </p>
  
            <h3>Do Not Track Policy</h3>
            <p>
              Some browsers have a "do not track" (DNT) feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. There is no agreed-upon standard for how websites should respond to DNT signals, and we do not currently respond to them. ProactiveWellness Care is aware of the ongoing development of DNT standards and will update its policy accordingly.
            </p>
  
            <h3>How We Use & Share Your Data</h3>
            <p>
              ProactiveWellness Care uses and shares your personal data based on our legitimate business interests, your consent, our legal obligations, and/or to provide the website to you.

              ProactiveWellness Care may also combine and/or remove any identifying information from the personal data we collect through the website, so that it is no longer considered personal data. We do this to create other data that we can use and share for any purpose, if it does not identify you or any other individual.
            </p>
  
            <h3>How We Use Data for Analytics</h3>
