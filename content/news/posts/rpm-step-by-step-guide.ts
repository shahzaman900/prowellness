These devices can be wearable, such as smartwatches or continuous glucose monitors, or non-wearable, such as blood pressure cuffs or pulse oximeters. The devices can send your data to a secure platform that your provider can access and review. Your provider can also communicate with you through the platform, such as sending you alerts, reminders, feedback, or education.",
