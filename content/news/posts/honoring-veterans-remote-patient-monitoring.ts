As we reflect on their service, it is equally vital that we ensure they receive the continued care and attention they deserve, long after their time in uniform. At ProactiveWellness Care, we believe technology is the key to bridging the gap between patients and providers. This is especially true for veterans living with chronic conditions or those in areas with limited healthcare access. One of the most powerful tools in this effort is Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) for veterans.",
