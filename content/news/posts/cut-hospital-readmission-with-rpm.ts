According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), approximately 1 in 5 Medicare patients are readmitted within 30 days of discharge, costing the healthcare system billions of dollars each year. Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) has been shown to be an effective tool in reducing hospital readmissions.",

      text: "Remote patient monitoring (RPM) devices are becoming an increasingly popular tool in reducing hospital readmissions. RPM involves the use of devices that allow patients to receive medical attention from their homes, while healthcare providers monitor the patient’s condition remotely. By keeping tabs on patients’ vital signs and other health metrics, healthcare providers can intervene before a serious condition worsens and requires hospitalization. Here are some examples of how medical institutions have reduced hospital readmissions using RPM devices",

The Journal of arthroplasty, 31(10), 2141-2146. Overall, these studies suggest that remote patient monitoring devices are an effective tool in reducing hospital readmissions for a variety of conditions. Specifically, by providing patients with the ability to monitor their health from home and alerting healthcare providers when a patient’s condition worsens, RPM devices allow for earlier intervention and potentially preventable hospital readmissions.",
