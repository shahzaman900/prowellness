A study conducted at the Dubai Diabetes Center (DDC) in the United Arab Emirates evaluated the impact of TM devices on glycemic control and compliance of 38 previously lost-to-follow-up (LTFU) patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).",

      text: "In the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, diabetes affects 55 million people, with a notably higher prevalence (12.8%) than the global average (nearly 9.3%) in 2019. After Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has one of the highest diabetes burdens in the Middle East (16.3%).",

      text: "Although several well-established behavioral and therapeutic interventions exist for diabetes, patient outcomes are still poor, with a high incidence of diabetes-related complications. Diabetes-related complications can be prevented or delayed with intensive glucose control. Nevertheless, up to 60%–78.2% of adult patients with diabetes in the MENA region are inadequately controlled. In UAE, a five-year retrospective study noted that only 37.7% of the population with diabetes in Dubai had HbA1c <7%.",

      type: "paragraph",
      text: "Generally, inadequate home blood glucose (BG) monitoring, nonadherence with medications or recommended lifestyle behaviors (nutrition and exercise), suboptimal patient education about the disease, and limited access to health experts are all factors that may lead to suboptimal BG control. Loss-to-follow-up (LTFU) is one of the primary drivers of poor diabetes outcomes in well-resourced countries.",

      type: "paragraph",

      text: "Therefore, several researchers proposed the application of telemedicine, including telemonitoring (TM) and teleconsultation, to optimize and improve the management of patients with T2DM. The cumulative body of evidence highlights that the application of telemedicine results in committed patients, which may improve glycemic control and reduce the need for hospital admissions.",

BG control could be enhanced safely by adjusting drugs based on home BG readings reported to clinicians remotely.",

People with diabetes are classified as a high-risk group for severe COVID-19 illness and are advised to maintain social distancing measures. These measures have negatively impacted the access of patients to healthcare providers.",

      text: "For a chronic disease such as diabetes that requires careful BG monitoring along with recurrent physician consultation, telemedicine can be a viable alternative for patients seeking medical guidance without physical attendance to the clinics and increasing their risk of COVID-19 infection. Telemedicine represents a valuable tool for remote patient consultation and early recognition of possible diabetes complications, signs of blood glucose dysregulation, and infection.",
