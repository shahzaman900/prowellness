        "Increased Patient Engagement: RPM promotes patient engagement by enabling patients to take an active role in their healthcare. Patients can track their health data, such as blood pressure, heart rate, and share it with their healthcare provider. This enables informed decisions and encourages patients to proactively manage their chronic conditions.",
        "Improved Quality of Care: RPM allows healthcare providers to monitor their patients' health in real-time. This enables them to detect and respond to potential health issues quickly. This can result in early intervention, which can prevent complications and improve health outcomes.",
        "Cost-Effective: RPM has the potential to reduce healthcare costs by reducing hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and other costly interventions. By remotely monitoring patients' health, healthcare providers can detect potential health issues early. This allows physicians to take action before they escalate into more serious health problems.",
